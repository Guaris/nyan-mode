* Nyan Mode
Nyan Mode is an analog indicator of your position in the buffer. The
Cat should go from left to right in your mode-line, as you move your
point from 0% to 100%.

* Known issues
It's my second attempt to write a minor mode in Emacs, so there will
definiely be some bugs.

This version uses XPM images, which should be supported by default by
most Emacs 23 installations, Windows included. In case it doesn't
work, try switching to master-png branch. This branch, however, may
have it's own issues:

There was a problem with displaying PNG images, which require libpng
to be available for Emacs. The lib is sometimes missing (e.g. some
Windows installation). To make it work on Windows, one needs to
download a proper DLL and put it into emacs bin/ folder. To see which
DLL is needed, do: M-x describe-variable <ret> image-library-alist
<ret>.

So far it didn't work on Emacs 24 :(. Any help with that would be appreciated.

Customizing nyan-animate-nyancat is broken; don't do it.

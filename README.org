* Nyan Mode - Turn your Emacs into Nyanmacs! :)

WARNING, MIND DUMBING CONTENT INSIDE.

Nyan Mode is an analog indicator of your position in the buffer. The
Cat should go from left to right in your mode-line, as you move your

  - Customizable properties.

For animated Nyan Cat, I used frames [[http://media.photobucket.com/image/nyan%20cat%20sprites/DryBowser455/th_NyanCatSprite.png?t=1304659408][by DryBowser455]]. There's also a
standing Nyan and rainbow image, extracted from a gif similar to [[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ozp7QtT81xM/TkVqBTYkhjI/AAAAAAAABeM/ZyuDkGeAS6w/s1600/nyan2.gif][this one]].
